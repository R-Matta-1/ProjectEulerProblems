    "Although no one has proved it yet, it is thought that some numbers, like $196$, never produce a palindrome. A number that never forms a palindrome through the reverse and add process is called a Lychrel number. Due to the theoretical nature of these numbers, and for the purpose of this problem, we shall assume that a number is Lychrel until proven otherwise. In addition you are given that for every number below ten-thousand, it will either (i) become a palindrome in less than fifty iterations, or, (ii) no one, with all the computing power that exists, has managed so far to map it to a palindrome. In fact, $10677$ is the first number to be shown to require over fifty iterations before producing a palindrome: $4668731596684224866951378664$ ($53$ iterations, $28$-digits).\n",
